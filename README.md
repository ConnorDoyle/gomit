# GoMit

[![Build Status](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/intelsdilabs/gomit.svg?token=2ujsxEpZo1issFyVWX29&branch=master)](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/intelsdilabs/gomit)

GoMit provides facilities for defining, emitting, and handling events within a go service.

This was originally written to provide a simple interface for an event-based observer pattern within a go service.

Core principles:
1. Speed over abstraction
2. No order guarrantees
3. No persistence
